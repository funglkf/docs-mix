## Soft & Hard Line Breaks


``` md
Put 2 spaces at the end of a line
to force a line break.
If you simply
hit enter and
don't use 2 spaces
it merges the lines
like this.
You can also force a break <br> anywhere
using the `<br>` tag like we just did
```

4. but it will fix them if not

[Reference-Style Links][some reference id]
put link at bottom of paragraph or page.
you can use numbers or text for

or leave it empty and
just use the [link text itself]

use `{target=_blank} or {.new-tab}` attributes
use it on [ref links][new tab]{.new-tab} too

## Abbreviations



```markdown
here are some abbr's
HTML and FUBAR

>:bulb: if your editor gets confused by
not having and enclosing * then
just add it to end of abbr def.

---

>:warning: Don't indent these, doesn't seem to work

*[abbr]: Abbreviations
*[def]: Definition
*[HTML]: Hyper Text Markup Language

## Footnotes



```markdown
Footnotes[^1] work like reference links
They auto-number like ordered lists[^3]
You can use any
reference id[^text reference]
like ref links they can be
organized at bottom
of paragraph or page.

  [^1]: footnote, click the return icon here to go back ->
  [^3]: the number will not necessarily be what you use
  [^text reference]: text reference
```

## Tables



```markdown
Colons can be used to align columns.
3 dashes min to separate headers.
Outer pipes (|) are optional,
and you don't need to make the
raw Markdown line up prettily.
You can also use inline Markdown.

|  Tables  |      Are      |   Cool    |
| -------- |:-------------:| ---------:|
| col 3 is | right-aligned |     $1600 |
| col 2 is |   centered    |       $12 |
|          |   **Total**   |   **$1612** |

==Table== | **Format** | ðŸ‘€ _scramble_
--- | --- | ---
*Still* | `renders` | **nicely**
icons _cloud_{.icon} | footnotes[^1] | use `<br>` <br> for multi-line <br> line breaks

```

## Blockquotes



```markdown
> Blockquotes are handy to callout text.
they are greedy and will keep
grabbing text. The '>' is optional unless trying join
>
paragraphs, tables etc.

a blank line and a new paragraph
or other markdown thing end them

>:bulb:
use a `---` seperator or `<br>`
if you want multiple sepearte block quotes

---

> can have nested
> > blockquotes inside of block quotes
block quotes can also contain any valid markdown

```

use blockquotes
with emoji indicators for
admonition memos, callout etc..

---

> :boom:
Title title like above is optional

---

> :bulb: See [the section about blocks](2.cheat_sheet.md#cheatsheet)
for the list of emojis that can be used.

## Row Divs

---



    > :bug: **here is another example**
    this uses the row class and will make
    any blocks, figures, etc equal spaced

    ---

    > :thumbsup: they will be equal sizes
    with whatever width is left from image
    and as you can see the heights get adjusted to be equal as well

    ---





> :bug: **here is another example**
